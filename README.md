in every decent system, there is always redundant systems...
but internet has No Redundant system...

modern technology allows decentralization of internet.

The idea is simple...
create a Global Lan Party,

SFP+ has speeds up to 10Gbps FullDuplex using Fiber Optic,
there are Short Range and Long Range laser modules,

SR has a wavelenght of 850nm 
and allows upto 300meters with OM3 cable,
only 30 meters with OM1 cable.

Lc-Lc cable,
color coded, Orange is ShortRange,
Yellow and Cyan are Long Range,
but they are actually called Multimode = SR,
Monomode = LR.

LongRange modules have a wavelenght of 1600nm 
and allow up to 80Km range, 
but are Not cheap, with OM5/6 cable.

The idea is to create an 8 friend network,
all bridged together.
in all cardinal points,
North, South, East, West, NorthEast, SouthEast, NorthWest, SouthWest.

Each Member of the 8-Club, must have a powerful Router.
The ideal would be ccr1072, 72-core 1GHz CPU,
minimum a ccr2004-12s+
The crs317-16s+ is cheap, but Not fast enough,

There are many other brands and options,
like Honeycomb LX2 16-core ARMv8 CPU,
has 4x SFP+ 
there is higher model also with 100G,

anyway....

Open internet is based on the Theory of 6° of separation,
to create the Network,
but Not 6, 8.

it would be a LAN IP4 Network,

it could have Clock problems, 
someone would have to connect a Rubidum Time Server
to a fixed IP
probably 255.255.255.255 or 1.1.1.1
and all routers & computers in the Network,
in-sync to a common Time Server.
or individual Time servers connected to GPS satellites.

the Network would Not have DNS servers at first,
each friend must know the IP of the server you want to connect,
like old times, land line, you must know the phone number you want to dial.
in the future a search engine can be introduced.

RouterOS allows Dynamic or Fixed IP.

Earth has aprox 40000km of circumference,
Opne internet is a Giant Lan party,
each "IP friend" is separated 80km from each other,
Only requires 500 friends to have 1° of Earth totally connected.
and 365x more for the Whole Earth to be connected.
182500 Friends minimum to create Open Internet.

but the magic of the 6° of separation theory
is that you dont need to know the whole chain.

one link only needs to know 2 more links in each Cardinal point.

The Goal of 80km per friend is too long,

40km between friends = 1000 friends per 1°, and 365000 friends for 365° coverage.
20km between friends = 2000 friends per 1°, and 730000 friends for 365° coverage.
10km between friends = 4000 friends per 1°, and 1.5 Million friends for 365° coverage.
1km between friends = 40000 friends per 1°, and 15 Million friends for 365° coverage.

some will have more, others will have less.

But there are problems, like the ocean,
creating a underwater server in the middle of the ocean with a floating solar panel,
is possible.
but at night requires battery,
and battery dont last long used in deep cycles, requires constant maintenance,
LiPo is expensive, 
The ideal would be Super Capacitors, to avoid constant maintenance.
but requires a large amount, and are very expensive.

all inside a sealed double laeyr case, IP68 or better.
Like those Plastic cases from SKB and similar.
white color to avoid melting with sun light
and overheating the electronic components.

its a very intense colaborative effort,

Nothing is easy,
When Edison hired a boat to put the 1st underground telegram cable between Americas and Europe,
had a Sabotage, cable was driller and pierced making it useless.
had to do it again.
perseverance.

in cities, the cable can be easy extended over buildings or under the floor,
using RC vehicles,
No need to do it manually, like the Mutan Ninja Turtles. LOL.™

it would take decades before is fully operational, maybe 100 years,
2 generations, but is possible.

i think is very important for the future to create a 2nd internet.
Open internet.

This is Not my idea, the seed was planted by Time Travelers in a Dream.
