in every decent system, there is always redundant systems, </br>
but internet has No Redundant system... </br>

modern technology allows decentralization of internet. </br>

The idea is simple... </br>
create a Global Lan Party, </br>

SFP+ has speeds up to 10Gbps FullDuplex using Fiber Optic, </br>
there are Short Range and Long Range laser modules, </br>

SR has a wavelenght of 850nm  </br>
and allows upto 300meters with OM3 cable, </br>
only 30 meters with OM1 cable. </br>

Lc-Lc cable, </br>
color coded, Orange is ShortRange, </br>
Yellow and Cyan are Long Range, </br>
but they are actually called Multimode = SR, </br>
Monomode = LR. </br>

LongRange modules have a wavelenght of 1600nm  </br>
and allow up to 80Km range, </br>
but are Not cheap, with OM5/6 cable. </br>

There is Single Ended or Dual Ended. </br>
In Dual: has 2x Laser per module Tx & Rx has same Wavelengh, example 850nm, </br>
and information could phase cancel, thats why Tx & Rx has independent FiberOptic "2-Wires". </br>
in Single Ended: SFP+ module has dual frequency, like radio stations. </br>
Information can be Tx & Rx on a single Fiber. "1-Wire"</br>

but that does Not matter for small installations, </br>
because large 10km rolls have 6 pairs of Fiber, </br>
like Snakes in Pro Audio. </br>

The idea is to create an 8x friend network, </br>
all bridged together, </br>
in all cardinal points, </br>
North, South, East, West, NorthEast, SouthEast, NorthWest, SouthWest. </br>

Each Friend of the 8-Club, must have a powerful Router. </br>
ideal would be ccr1072, 72-core 1GHz CPU, </br>
recommended a ccr2004-12s+ </br>
The crs317-16s+ is cheap, but CPU is Not fast enough. </br>

There are other brands and options, </br>
like Honeycomb LX2 16-core ARMv8 CPU, </br>
has 4x SFP+ </br>
and the higher model with 100G, </br>

Open internet is based on the Theory of 6° of separation, </br>
to create the Network, but Not 6, 8. </br>
https://youtu.be/-8w-3oe1uJo </br>

see the video to continue reading... </br>

it could have Clock problems, </br>
someone would have to connect a Rubidum Time Server </br>
to a fixed IP </br>
probably 255.255.255.255 or 1.1.1.1 </br>
and all routers & computers in the Network, </br>
in-sync to a common Time Server. </br>
or individual Time servers connected to GPS satellites. </br>

the Network would Not have DNS servers at first, </br>
each friend must know the IP of the server you want to connect, </br>
like old times, land line, you must know the phone number you want to dial. </br>
in the future a search engine can be introduced. </br>

Router allows Dynamic or Fixed IP. </br>

Earth has aprox 40000km of circumference, </br>
Open internet is a Giant Lan party, </br>
each "IP friend" is separated 80km from each other, </br>
Only requires 500 friends to have 1° of Earth totally connected. </br>
Earth in the past was measured in Nautic Miles. </br>
365x more for the Whole Earth to be connected. </br>
182500 Friends to create Open Internet. </br>

but the magic of the 6° of separation theory </br>
is that you dont need to know the whole chain. </br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8w-3oe1uJo </br>
one link only needs to know 2 more links in opposing Cardinal points. </br>

The Goal of 80km per friend is too long, </br>
40km between friends = 1000 friends per 1°, and 365000 friends for 365° coverage. </br>
20km between friends = 2000 friends per 1°, and 730000 friends for 365° coverage. </br>
10km between friends = 4000 friends per 1°, and 1.5 Million friends for 365° coverage. </br>
1km between friends = 40000 friends per 1°, and 15 Million friends for 365° coverage. </br>

some will have more, others will have less. </br>

But there are problems, like the ocean, </br>
creating a underwater server in the middle of the ocean with a floating solar panel, </br>
is possible. </br>
but at night requires battery, </br>
and battery dont last long used in deep cycles, requires constant maintenance, </br>
LiPo is expensive, </br>
The ideal would be Super Capacitors to avoid constant maintenance. </br>
but requires a large amount, and are very expensive. </br>

all inside a sealed double layer case, IP68 or better. </br>
Like those Molded Plastic cases from SKB and similar. </br>
white color to avoid melting with sun light </br>
and overheating the electronic components. </br>

its a very intense colaborative effort, </br>

Nothing is easy, </br>
When Edison hired a boat to put the 1st underground telegram cable between Americas and Europe, </br>
had a Sabotage, cable was driller and pierced making it useless. </br>
had to do it again. </br>
perseverance. </br>

in cities, the cable can be easy extended over buildings or under the floor, </br>
using RC vehicles, </br>
No need to do it manually, like the Mutan Ninja Turtles. LOL.™ </br>

it would take decades before is fully operational, maybe 100 years, </br>
2 generations, but is possible. </br>

i think is very important for the future to create a 2nd internet. </br>
Open internet. </br>

This is Not my idea, the seed was planted in a Dream. </br>
